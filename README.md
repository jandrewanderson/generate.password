## Objectives

The purpose of this assignment was to create a page that will showcase my future work in web deveolopment. The page was intended to fit on all screen sizes as well as having links to different sections of the page as well as to outside sources. I currently have links to some of my favorite social media, gaming, and streaming services. These will serve as placeholders for the future web pages that I will post here.

I also received some help from a number of members from my class as well as my instructor. Each of them helped me by helping me understand the way that javascript elements work and would give me hints of things to research. A lot of help came from Vidal Tan.
