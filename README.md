# generate.password

## Objectives

The purpose of this assignment was to create a program in javascript that will generate a random password from a character list determined by the user. The length of the password will also be determined by the user. This project was intended to teach the different uses of functions in javascript, how they can interact with arrays, and implement them into a code that will accomplish a specific task. A few of the variables and basic functions were provided by the instructor.

I also received some help from a number of members from my class as well as my instructor. Each of them helped me by helping me understand the way that javascript elements work and would give me hints of things to research. A lot of help came from Vidal Tan.
